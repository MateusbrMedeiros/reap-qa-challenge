## ðŸ“Œ Test Strategy â€“ `DELETE /BookStore/v1/Books` & `DELETE /BookStore/v1/Book`

These tests cover **removal operations** for books, including bulk deletion (`/Books`) and individual deletion (`/Book`) from a userâ€™s collection. Both require proper authorization and a valid user context.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Ensure users can delete books successfully.
- Validate authorization handling for both bulk and single deletions.
- Verify error messages when trying to delete nonexistent or already-deleted books.
