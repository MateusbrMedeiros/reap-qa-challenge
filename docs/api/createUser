## ðŸ“Œ Test Strategy â€“ `POST /Account/v1/User`

This set of tests focuses on validating the behavior of the user creation endpoint under **positive scenarios**, ensuring that:

- Users can be created successfully with valid credentials.
- Special characters in usernames are handled appropriately.
- Sensitive information (e.g., passwords) is never returned in the API response.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Ensure valid user creation returns the expected status code and behavior.
- Confirm that the API supports usernames with special characters.
- Verify that security rules are enforced (passwords are never exposed in responses).
